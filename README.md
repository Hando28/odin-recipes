# odin-recipes

The odin recipes project calls upon the user to create a website featuring pictures and the preparation requirements of multiple food dishes. 

I began the project by creating a new project repository.

Then, a directory for the recipe files to reside in was created. 

An index file was created and populated with the standard html boilerplate. 

Next, three recipe files were created (mac.html, potatoes.html, and turkey.html).

Links to the three recipe files were embedded into the website's index via <a href=>

Images of the finished recipe's were added to all three recipes pages via <img src=>

Appropriate headings were given to all project pages and elements within.

Unordered lists were created for the "ingredients" sections of the individual recipe pages.

Ordered lists were created for the "steps" sections of the individual recipe pages.

Code was staged and committed intermittently throughout the odin recipes project. 

As I worked through the project, I gained a better understanding of commits as well as how to utilize commit messages.
